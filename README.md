# Pokémon Polished Crystal - Abated

**Version:** 0.1  
**Polished Crystal Version:** 3.1.1

This is a modified version of [Polished Crystal](https://github.com/Rangi42/polishedcrystal) that reduces trainer pokemon IVs (DVs) and EVs back to their original values from vanilla Crystal.

It was created for those who want to experience how amazing Polished Crystal is but prefer a difficulty closer to that of the mainline vanilla games. It will still be slightly more difficult due to trainers having improved movesets and AI.

All credit goes to Rangi42 and whomever they credit. I only changed a few values back to the originals defined in the [pokecrystal disassembly](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal).

### ⚠️ WARNING ⚠️

This has seen minimal testing. I didn't play the entire game and I have no clue how to test a ROM hack like this beyond playing it. There may be bugs.

## Details

* Trainers have IVs (DVs) reset to vanilla values
* Trainers have EVs reset to vanilla values (0 for all trainers)
* Trainers new to Polished Crystal have thir IVs (DVs) set to the vanilla values of similar trainers

## FAQ

### 1. Can I use this with an existing Polished Crystal save?

TODO: test this.

Maybe? This doesn't change anything that gets saved, but the ROM changing may break saves. No clue without doing some testing.
